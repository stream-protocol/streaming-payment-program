# StreamPay Solana Program

StreamPay is a Solana-based program that enables the creation and management of payment streams. Payment streams allow for the automated distribution of funds over time, making it useful for applications like recurring payments, salary disbursements, and more.

## Introduction

Payment streams are a fundamental concept in StreamPay. They consist of a payer, a recipient, and various parameters that define how payments are distributed over time. StreamPay provides a programmatic interface for creating, updating, and managing these payment streams on the Solana blockchain.

## Architecture

StreamPay follows a typical Solana program architecture, comprising the following components:

- **Processor:** The core logic of the program is implemented in the `Processor` struct. It defines methods for initializing payment streams, withdrawing funds, terminating streams, and more.

- **PaymentStream:** The `PaymentStream` struct represents an individual payment stream. It contains information about the payer, recipient, stream parameters, and its current state.

- **Instruction:** The program uses custom instructions to interact with the processor. These instructions include initializing a stream, withdrawing funds, pausing/resuming a stream, and querying a stream's details.

- **Error Handling:** StreamPay defines custom error types, such as `StreamError`, to handle specific error conditions that may arise during program execution.

- **Constants:** The program may define constants, such as minimum amounts and operational fee rates, which are used in various calculations.

## How It Works

1. **Initialize a Payment Stream:** Users can create a new payment stream by sending an instruction to the program. They specify the payer, recipient, start time, payment interval, amount per interval, and other parameters. The program initializes the stream and stores its details.

2. **Withdraw Funds:** The recipient of a payment stream can withdraw funds periodically based on the specified interval and amount per interval. The program calculates the maximum amount that can be withdrawn at a given time and transfers the funds.

3. **Terminate Stream:** Either the payer or the recipient can choose to terminate a payment stream. Upon termination, the program may handle specific logic, such as early termination penalties or remaining fund transfers.

4. **Pause and Resume Streams:** Payment streams can be paused and resumed as needed, allowing for flexibility in managing payments.

5. **Query Stream Details:** Users can query the details of a payment stream to retrieve information about its current state.

## Getting Started

To get started with StreamPay, follow these steps:

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) if you haven't already.

2. Clone the StreamPay repository: `git clone https://github.com/stream-protocol/streaming-payment-program.git`

3. Build the program: `cargo build-bpf`

4. Deploy the program to the Solana blockchain.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to interact with StreamPay using Solana's command-line tools:

1. Initialize a payment stream:
   ```
   solana-tokens program transfer ...
   ```

2. Withdraw funds:
   ```
   solana-tokens program transfer ...
   ```

3. Terminate a stream:
   ```
   solana-tokens program transfer ...
   ```

4. Pause and resume streams:
   ```
   solana-tokens program transfer ...
   ```

5. Query stream details:
   ```
   solana-tokens program transfer ...
   ```
